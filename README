Schedule/TableImage version 1.00
=  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==  ==

Schedule::TableImage absolutely relies on Image::Magick being installed on your system.
Schedule::TableImage creates a image of a schedule with labelled events. 
This schedule image is a grid in which days are labelled horizontally and hours are labelled vertically.  
This is useful to a week view, although you can have as many days as you would like, with any label you like.
Events are colored boxes with text labels for a given time and day. 
If events overlap on a given day or time, the width of the day expands to accomodate both (or all) events.
